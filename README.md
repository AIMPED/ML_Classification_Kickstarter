# ML_Classification_Kickstarter
In [this notebook](ML_Classification_Kickstarter_MASTER.ipynb) we explore the Kickstarter.com dataset, that someone kindly scraped for us from the Kickstarter website. We try to predict the success of the campaigns based on the data available to us.
There are two scripts, [one](raw_convert.py) is to preprocess the csv files and save them as one large csv file; the [other script](train_save_model.py) is to train a random forest classifier model and save the model to a file.
